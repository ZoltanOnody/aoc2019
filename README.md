# Advent of Code 2019

Advent of Code is here!

I'm a very competitive person but waking up early is not my strong side. So, instead of waking up 4 hours earlier every day and compete with other, I decided to do something else. I'll challenge myself to solve the problems each day in a different programming language. I'm planning to write some basic unit/integration test for _most of_ my solutions and also provide all the resources I used for solving the problems.


## Why?

Why not. At least I'll look into some new languages I've never used before.


## Used languages

| Day | Language |
|-----|----------|
| 1   | bash     |
| 2   | elm      |
| 3   | ruby     |
| 4   | haskell  |
| 5   | php      |
| 6   | python   |
| 7*  | perl     |
